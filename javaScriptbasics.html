                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility fo rdevelopers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected the objects of these environmenets to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="Variable Declaration">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="Variable Assignment">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="Data">Data</a> Types Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. Tehre are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number 42 or 3.13159; String - "Coding Dojo rocks!"; Array - [1, 'coding', 2, 'dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="Conditionals">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specific condnition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="Loops">Loops</a> there are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track for times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="Function">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our functiont his will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
